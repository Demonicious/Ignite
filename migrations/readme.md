Put all of your Ignite Migrations in here.
Migrations will only be run once, unless you roll them back.

Many plugins will have their own migrations, you must put these migrations here and use the CLI to upgrade all of them.
Other plugins also make use of the Activate / Uninstall method to create / remove database tables.
